Datasets with annotated music clips from various languages:
- English: MER_audio_taffc_dataset
- Chinese: CH-818
- Turkish: tr-music-dataset
For memory purposes, we only kept the .csv files with the extracted features for each.

For individual experiments with each dataset, see EnglishMER.ipynb, ChineseMER.ipynb, TurkishMER.ipynb.

For cross-cultural experiments, see CompareMER.ipynb. This can be run independently from the others,
as it only loads data from the .csv files.

For more details, see Cross_CulturalMER.pdf, the associated paper for this project.
